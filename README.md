# ORB1T V19.0 ALPHA
**Elevator pitch**

OBJEX V19.0 is designed for those who develop IoT projects. All the sensors and basic parts, no soldering needed.

### What is it?

ORB1T V19.0 is designed for those who develop IoT projects. This development board includes all sensors and base parts, no soldering needed. 
I decided to make ORB1T V19.0 to improve the development of my IoT projects. Usually, I have to use multiple modules creating a tangle of cables.

### Why I made this?

I made ORB1T v19 for my IoT projects, because the Arduino uno and other similar platforms are not ready for IoT applications.
So in December 2019 I Designed ORB1T V19 in only 2 weeks. Orbit v19 is the perfect solution for your iot project, because you have microcontroller/wifi connection and sensors in a single board.

### With ORB1T V19, you don't need

- External shields (Bme280, sensors ecc..)
- Breadboard or similar
- Wires

> **For example:** You can isolate an sensor from the power/data bus.

### Database ready to use

- **Firebase** *is perfect for sync app data in milliseconds*
- **Redis** *is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed*
- **MySql** *is an open-source relational database management system*

> **NOTE:** You can use other databases like MongoDB.

### Features

- **ESP12E** (Microcontroller with WiFi Module)
- **USB-C and microUSB-B**
- **CP2104** (USB-to-UART Bridge Controller)
- **BME280** (Atmospheric pressure, altitude, humidity and temperature)
- **APDS9960** (Proximity, Light, RGB and Gesture Sensor)
- **MPU-6050** (Triple Axis Accelerometer and Gyro)
- **WS2812B** (RGB PIXEL LED)
- **AMS1117-3.3** (Voltage regulator)
- **SMART power/data BUS** (Management of each component - power/data)

> **NOTE:** This is a prototype so some of these components have been added to test some additional features.
