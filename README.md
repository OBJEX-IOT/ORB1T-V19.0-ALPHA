# ORB1T V19.0 ALPHA
**Elevator pitch**

OBJEX V19.0 is designed for those who develop IoT projects. All the sensors and basic parts, no soldering needed.

### What is it?

ORB1T V19.0 is designed for those who develop IoT projects. This development board includes all sensors and base parts, no soldering needed. 
I decided to make ORB1T V19.0 to improve the development of my IoT projects. Usually, I have to use multiple modules creating a tangle of cables.

### Why I made this?

I made ORB1T v19 for my IoT projects because the Arduino UNO and other similar platforms are not ready for IoT applications. 
So in December 2019, I Designed ORB1T V19 in only 2 weeks. Orbit v19 is the perfect solution for your IoT projects because you 
have microcontroller/wifi connection and sensors in a single board.

### IoT with ORB1T V19.0

With this board, you have easy access to sensors, you can isolate them, you can add another microcontroller.
Remember, this is a prototype/concept. My next goal is to increase the functionality of ORB1T.

### With ORB1T V19, you don't need

- External shields (Bme280, sensors ecc..)
- Breadboard or similar
- Wires

<br />

> **For example:** You can isolate an sensor from the power/data bus.

<br />

### Database ready to use

- **Firebase** *is perfect for sync app data in milliseconds*
- **Redis** *is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed*
- **MySql** *is an open-source relational database management system*

<br />

> **NOTE:** You can use other databases like MongoDB.

<br />

### Features

- **ESP12E** (Microcontroller with WiFi Module)
- **USB-C and microUSB-B**
- **CP2104** (USB-to-UART Bridge Controller)
- **BME280** (Atmospheric pressure, altitude, humidity and temperature)
- **APDS9960** (Proximity, Light, RGB and Gesture Sensor)
- **MPU-6050** (Triple Axis Accelerometer and Gyro)
- **WS2812B** (RGB PIXEL LED)
- **AMS1117-3.3** (Voltage regulator)
- **SMART power/data BUS** (Management of each component - power/data)

<br />

> **NOTE:** This is a prototype so some of these components have been added to test some additional features.  

<br />

### Issues

- **(A)** VLOGIC status for MPU6050
- **(B)** Logic Level Converter for WS2812B (3.3V to 5V)

<br />

> **A:** I added an external bridge 

> **B:** I used an external shield with BSS138

<br />

### The future of this ORB1T?

In the next three months, I will make a new version of ORB1T. For example, I would use a new microcontroller, new sensors and more. 
I will fix some problems of ORB1T V19.0. Does the future belong to ORB1T V20? We'll see!
